      <description>History Northgate Computer Systems was founded in 1987, and they used to sell personal computers. They sold their products through direct marketing. However, their Omnikey keyboards were sold through dealers. Before the introduction of Omnikey series keyboards, Northgate badged keyboards from several companies such as Focus and Monterey, and some of the initial Omnikey models are said to be manufactured by Focus.&#xA;The first generation of Omnikey models was sold in the late ’88s, and the Omnikey Ultra series was manufactured in the mid-’90s.</description>
