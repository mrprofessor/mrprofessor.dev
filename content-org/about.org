I build large and scalable web applications at work. I dream of building
tiny and useful applications at home.

I can probably free up some hours in a week for software consulting if I
like your idea. You can even hire me full-time if you are shipping
applications with a [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html][Free Software Foundation]] license.

If you need any help regarding any of my articles do drop a comment
instead sending me e-mails.

Thanks for showing interest. Go away now. Bye!
